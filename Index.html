		<p>I am a senior in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I am doing an independent pathway as my major to analyze how consulting can potentially become a future pathway at SI.</p>

		<p>Prior to enrolling at the University of Michigan, I was a student at Lansing Community College where I had returned to the classroom in 2015. It was there that I had been afforded the opportunity to learn more about the Michigan State Legislature as an intern for a State Senator.</p>
