	<main>
	<p>I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. I lived there until I moved to Michigan in 2014. I decided to move here to be closer to family that lives here. I also thought this was a great opportunity to experience the world outside of Texas. My dad and sister and her family currently live in Austin, Texas. After graduation I will be moving back and hoping to work in a member of Congress' district office.</p>
	<p>Before moving to Ann Arbor, Michigan for school, I was living in Lansing, Michigan. I lived there for a year, but I was in the city often for the past three years since I was attending Lansing Community College.</p>
	<p>Attending Lansing Community College was the best decision I ever made. Being in the state capital, I was near the state legsilature and it was there where I would get my first experience of working as an intern in a state senator's office. That was a very beneficial experience and has helped me ever since then.</p>
	<p>Prior to living in Lansing, I was living in Lake Odessa, Michigan with my uncle, Bob Warner. I stayed with him when I moved to Michigan, which was great, because I got to know him more. The first year I was living in Michigan I worked in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I worked at an auto dealership, which was actually very fun. I got to drive cars that I never thought I would sit in and made some of my closest friends here in Michigan.</p>
	<p>I wanted to share a few images that I am quite fond of and believed offer a lens into my life and who I am as a person. The first being my father and me when I was a child. He and I are very close and he is the reason why I work so hard in life. The second image is of the San Antonio Spurs after their 2014 Championship victory. I love basketball and being a native son of San Antonio I had to share this, so this combines two things I am passionate about.</p>
	<p>The next two images are of my alma mater <a href="https://www.cchs-satx.org/">Central Catholic High School</a>, and one of my favorite bands, <a href="https://www.daftpunk.com/">Daft Punk.</a></p>
	<p>This is just one of my favorite gifs of Coach Howard dancing after they beat Kentucky. I occassionaly dance like this for fun when I am in a good move. Better yet, this is my celebratory dance when I graduate.</p>
