	<p>I wasn't really sure what else to put, so this is what I did for now. However, after much thought, I figured out what I wanted to say. These past three years of being at the University of Michigan have been some of my best years in life so far. I have had the opportunity to get to know some incredible people that I now call friends and unprecented access to faculty that genuinely care about their students. I will always be grateful for this time. I have learned so much about myself and will be leaving with a quiet confidence that I can do anything I want in this world. When I moved to Michigan almost seven years ago I never imagined getting accepted in Michigan. The reality that I will be graduating next week is still a very surreal thought to me.</p>
	
	<p>It has been a truly arduous, but great journey getting to Ann Arbor. I am immensely proud that my dad who you have seen in my pictures will be here to witness this, because he made sacrfices for me that I now understand many would not do. He never gave up on me despite how many years it has taken me to graduate. He never once sowed doubt in my dreams of graduating from Michigan. He is the epitome of unconditonal love and support. As much as I wanted to do this for myself, I did this for my dad. My father did not get to graduate from high school and dropped after ninth grade. Despite this, I am always dumbfounded by how intelligent he is and I think had he been born in a different time in this country, I would be saying that he is a graduate of Michigan. This is for him.</p>

	<p>Thank you Professor van Lent, Bomi, and Ejike for making this a memorable semester. In spite of the challenges of learning virtually, I really enjoyed this course and feeling like I am coming away with a fairly good understanding of what I am doing when it comes to building websites. I am especially happy that this course focused so heavily on accessibilty. One of the reasons I came to the School of Information was to ensure in the future that government websites will create accessible websites for their residents. I wholeheartedly believe that access to information is part of the democratic process and if some constituents cannot use a political candidates or government agency's website, then we are doing a disservice to the people.</p>
