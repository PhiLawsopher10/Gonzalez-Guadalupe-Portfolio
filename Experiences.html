	<p>This is the first time I met Professor King in 2018 after a friend whom was admitted to SI introduced me to him. I was able to sit in on his class with her and she took this photo of us while we spoke. The next image is of me having the opportunity to speak at a rally that Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke at as the main speaker.</p>
